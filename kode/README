Flask requires at least GHC 6.10 and only works with TinyOS 1.x.

INSTALLATION
------------

The flask library should be installed using cabal.

EXAMPLES
--------

To build the examples, edit examples/common.mk and change the FLASK make
variable to the path to the flask source distribution. Then configure and build
flaskdb using cabal (you don't need to install it).

temp-query is an example query built using the flaskdb compiler. Once flaskdb is
built, it can be built like any other TinyOS program, with "make PLATFORM,"
where PLATFORM can be micaz, mica2, telosb or pc.

ewma is a simple EWMA filter using a synthetic data source.
